2. Enable `Prefer C/C++ Editor`
3. Provide clangd `path` and `Drivers` path as shown below.

## Disable CDT Indexer
As we are going to use clangd as the indexer and for editor features, we need to disable CDT indexer.

1. Go to `Window` > `Preferences` > `C/C++` > `Indexer`
2. Uncheck `Enable Indexer` option and then click on `Apply and Close`.

## Clangd Configuration File
To avoid the errors in the editor, you need to create a `.clangd` file at the root of the project and the below settings.

```
CompileFlags:
  Remove: [-fno-tree-switch-conversion, -fstrict-volatile-bitfields]

```
