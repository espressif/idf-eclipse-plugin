Why am I getting timeout errors when Installing tools?
------------------------------------------------------
If you are getting errors when downloading or installing tools this can be due to some issue with the mirrors. You can try to set the mirrors in Eclipse `Preferences > Espressif` you will see two settings for Git and Pip Py Wheels please set these to proper mirror according to your region. Currently, these two mirrors are available.

### Mirror for GIT (IDF_GITHUB_ASSETS)

- dl.espressif.cn/github_assets

### Mirror for python wheels (PIP_EXTRA_INDEX_URL)
- https://dl.espressif.com/pypi (default)
- https://dl.espressif.cn/pypi

How do I access CDT Parser error log?

How do I report a deadlock or Eclipse hang?
-------------------------------------------
You can find the detailed instructions here: https://wiki.eclipse.org/How_to_report_a_deadlock.
- On the command line, use `jps -v` to find the PIDs of Java processes and `jstack <pid>` to show the stack trace of Java processes.

Here 32308 and 8824 are PIDs of Java processes. 8824 is jps itself and is of no interest for us. 32308 is an Eclipse process judging from the presence of `org.eclipse.equinox.launcher` in its command line. The `jstack` command saves the stack trace of the Eclipse process in a file `/tmp/jstack.txt`, attach the file to the bug report.

`sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed:` error
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This would have been caused by the Java version or Java certificates. Please make sure you've installed `Java 11 and later` to fix this error.

Why Java 11 recommended for IDF Eclipse Plugin?
-----------------------------------------------
We recommend using Java 11 (that's the latest LTS version from Oracle) and above while working with IDF Eclipse Plugin considering Eclipse 2020-06 has a requirement for Java 11 to work with the CDT. Here are some important pointers from Eclipse.

### Installing CDT 9.11 on Eclipse 2020-06 and later requires a workaround when using Java 8
Check this - https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/NewIn911#Release

CDT 9.11 only requires Java 8 to run. However, a new feature in Eclipse 2020-06 and later means that the install wizard may prevent installation. The workaround is to disable "Verify provisioning operation is compatible with the currently running JRE" in Windows -> Preferences -> Install/Update. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=564407#c1.

### CDT 10.0 required Java 11 or later
Check this - https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/NewIn100

Starting with CDT 10.0, Java 11 or later is required to run CDT. This aligns with the requirements of Eclipse IDE which also requires Java 11 to run starting in 2020-09.

How to delete Launch Targets from the Eclipse
---------------------------------------------
There is no UI option to delete launch targets directly from Eclipse, however, this can be achieved by following the below instructions:
- Go to the Eclipse workspace directory. For example: In my case `/Users/myName/myTesteclipseWorkspace`.
- Navigate to `.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.core.runtime/.settings` folder in the workspace directory.
- Look for `org.eclipse.launchbar.core.prefs` file and open it in the editor.
- Search for the launch target name you want to delete and remove all those entries from the file.
- Save the file.
- Restart Eclipse.

How do I access project build log?
-----------------------------------
- To enable logging, navigate to `Preferences > Project > C/C++ > Build > Logging`.
- Check `Enable global build logging`.
- Build the project.
- Export `global-build.log`. This is the same build console log which appears in the CDT build console, but the build console usually has a limited buffer size, hence it won't display everything.

How do I enable verbose debug output to my project build?
----------------------------------------------------------
IDF Eclipse plugin uses CMake commands to build the project, so it's possible to pass CMake arguments from the build configuration wizard. To configure this:
- Click on the editor configuration wizard.
- Navigate to `Build Settings` tab.
- Add `--debug-output` or other
