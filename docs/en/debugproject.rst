In most cases, only two things are required to start debugging an ESP-IDF project:

1. Create a debug configuration
2. Check whether the board in the created configuration corresponds to the board in use.

.. note::  
    If you're using Windows, you may need to install drivers using Zadig to run a debug session successfully. For detailed instructions, please refer to this `guide <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/jtag-debugging/configure-ft2232h-jtag.html#configure-usb-drivers>`_.

The fastest way to create a debug configuration is as follows:

1. Expand the configuration list in the launch bar and click on ``New Launch Configuration...``.
2. Select ``ESP-IDF GDB OpenOCD Debugging``, then double-click or click ``Next``.
3. A preview of the new debug configuration will open, where you should check the board settings.

After creating the debug configuration, you can proceed with debugging the project:

1. Select the configuration you just created.
2. Choose ``Debug`` mode.
3. Click on the ``Debug`` icon |debug_icon| to start debugging.
