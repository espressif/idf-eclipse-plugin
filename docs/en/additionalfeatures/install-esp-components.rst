Install ESP-IDF Components
===============================
You can install the ESP-IDF Components directly into your project from the available components from the `ESP-IDF Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com/>`_. Follow the steps below:

- Right-click on the project in ``Project Explorer`` where you want to add the component, and select ``ESP-IDF > Install ESP-IDF Components``.
- A new window will open, displaying all available components to be installed.
- In the window, you can click on the ``Install`` button to add the selected component to the project. To access the README file for a component, click ``More Info``, which opens the README in your browser.

Already added components are also shown, but the ``Install`` button text changes to ``Already Added`` and is disabled.
