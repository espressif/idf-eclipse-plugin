Install ESP-IDF Components
==========================

:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`

You can install the ESP-IDF Components directly into your project from the available components in `ESP-IDF Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com/>`_. Follow the steps below:

1. Right-click on the project where you want to add the component in ``Project Explorer``, and select ``ESP-IDF: Install ESP-IDF Components``.
2. A new window will open, displaying all available components that can be installed.
3. In the window, click the ``Install`` button to add the selected component to your project. To view a component's README file, click ``More Info`` to open the README in your browser.

Already-added components are also shown, but the ``Install`` button text changes to ``Already Added`` and is disabled.
