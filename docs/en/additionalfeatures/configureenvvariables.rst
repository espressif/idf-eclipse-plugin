Configuring Environment Variables
================================

All the required environment variables are automatically configured by the IDE during the ESP-IDF and Tools installation process (``Espressif > ESP-IDF Manager > Add ESP-IDF``). You can verify these variables in the Preferences page under ``C/C++ > Build > Environment``.
