Suggestions for Build Errors using Hints Viewer
------------------------------------------------
If you encounter a problem during a build, there may be a hint for this error in the ESP-IDF hint database, located at ``tools/idf_py_actions/hints.yml`` in ESP-IDF. The ESP-IDF Eclipse plugin provides a hint viewer where you can type an error message to find a hint for it.

**Prerequisites:** The ``hints.yml`` file is available from ESP-IDF v5.0 and higher. If you are using an older version, you can manually download the ``hints.yml`` file from `here <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/tools/idf_py_actions/hints.yml>`_ and save it to ``esp-idf/tools/idf_py_actions/``. To download the file, right-click the ``Raw`` button and select ``Save as...``.

To open the hints viewer:
1. Navigate to ``Windows`` -> ``Show View`` -> ``Other...`` -> ``Espressif`` -> ``Hints``.

Now you can type or paste an error from the build log, such as:
``ccache error: Failed to create temporary file for esp-idf/libsodium/CMakeFiles/..../....: No such file or directory``

Double-clicking on the row will display the hint message if it doesn't fully fit on your screen.

Espressif IDF Tools Console

If this console is not active, switch to it by clicking on the ``Display Selected Console`` icon in the console view.
