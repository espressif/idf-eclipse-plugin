Once you have created a project and configured the esp target and serial port, you can build the project by clicking on |build_icon| in the toolbar.

However, below steps will guide you through the process of building the project if you are new to the IDE:

1. Select a project from the ``Project Explorer``.
2. Select ``Run`` from the first dropdown, which is called `Launch Mode`.
3. Select your application from the second dropdown, which is called `Launch Configuration` (Auto-detected).
4. Select a target from the third dropdown, for example, ``esp32``, which is called `Launch Target`.
5. Now click on the ``Build`` button |build_icon| to start the build process.

Custom Build Directory
----------------------

The IDE allows configuring a custom build directory for the project:

1. Select a project and click on the ``Edit`` button for the launch configuration in the top toolbar to open the ``Edit Configuration`` window.
2. Navigate to the ``Build Settings`` tab.
3. In the ``Additional CMake Arguments`` section, provide a custom build directory by adding arguments ``-B <custom build path>`` with an absolute path. The customized build directory path can be within the project or in any other location in the file system. For example: ``-B /Users/myUser/esp/generated``.
4. Click on ``Ok`` and build the project.

.. note::
   This configuration changes where all the project build artifacts will be generated.
