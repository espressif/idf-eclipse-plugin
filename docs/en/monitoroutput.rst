Monitor the Output
===============================

To see the serial output in Eclipse, we need to configure the `ESP-IDF Serial Monitor` to connect to the serial port. This is integrated with the `IDF Monitor <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/tools/idf-monitor.html#idf-monitor>`_.

3. Select the ``Serial Port`` for your board if it's not detected.
