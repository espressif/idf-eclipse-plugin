Configure Your Project
===============================

Project configuration is stored in a single file called ``sdkconfig`` located in the root directory of the project. This configuration file can be modified using the ``SDK Configuration Editor``.

To launch the SDK Configuration Editor:

#. Navigate to the ``sdkconfig`` file.
#. Double-click on the file to launch the SDK Configuration Editor.
#. Use ``Ctrl+S`` or ``Command+S`` based on your OS to save the changes. You can also use the Eclipse ``Save`` button from the toolbar.
#. To revert changes made in the SDK Configuration Editor, either close the editor without saving or right-click on the ``sdkconfig`` file and select ``Load sdkconfig`` to revert the changes from the editor.
