# Installing ESP-IDF

To install ESP-IDF directly from the Eclipse:

1. Go to `Espressif` > `Download and Configure ESP-IDF`.
1. From the `Download ESP-IDF` section, choose ESP-IDF version and directory to download.
1. Click on `Finish`.

To configure an existing ESP-IDF:

1. Go to `Espressif` > `Download and Configure ESP-IDF`.
1. Check `Use an existing ESP-IDF directory from the file system`.
1. Choose an existing ESP-IDF directory from the file system.
1. Click on `Finish`.

This will download a specified ESP-IDF version and configure `IDF_PATH` in the Eclipse CDT build environment variables.

![](docs/images/espidf_download.png)

# Installing ESP-IDF Tools

ESP-IDF requires some prerequisite tools to be installed so you can build firmware for the ESP32. The prerequisite tools include Python, Git, cross-compilers, menuconfig tool, CMake and Ninja build tools.

For this getting started guide, follow the instructions below.

1. Navigate to `Espressif` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install Tools`.
1. Provide the `ESP-IDF Directory` path.
1. Provide `Git` and `Python` executable locations if they are not auto-detected.
1. Click on `Install Tools` to proceed with the installation process. Check the Console for the installation details.
1. Installation might take a while if you're doing it for the first time since it has to download and install `xtensa-esp32-elf`, `esp32ulp-elf`, Cmake, `openocd-esp32` and Ninja tools.

> **Note:** Make sure you run this step even if you've already installed the required tools, since it sets the `IDF_PATH`, `PATH`, `OPENOCD_SCRIPTS` and `IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH` to the Eclipse CDT build environment based on the `idf_tools.py export` command.

![](docs/images/install_tools.png)

ESP-IDF Directory selection dialog:

<a name="NewProjectUsingDefault"></a>
# Create a new Project

1. Make sure you are in `C/C++ Perspective`.
1. Go to `File` > `New` > `Espressif IDF Project` (If you don't see this, please reset the perspective from `Window` > `Perspective` > `Reset Perspective...`).
1. Provide the `Project name` (The ESP-IDF build system does not support spaces in the project path).
1. Click `Finish`.

To create a project using existing ESP-IDF templates, please refer to [this](#NewProjectUsingTemplates).

> **Note:** You will see a lot of unresolved inclusion errors in the editor and those will be resolved only after the build.

![](docs/images/3_new_project_default.png)

<a name="ConfigureLaunchTarget"></a>
# Configuring Launch target

Next, we need to tell CDT to use the toolchain for our project so that all the headers will be indexed and resolved. This is accomplished through the Launch Bar, the new widget set you see on the far left of the toolbar. This will be shown only when you have a project in the `Project Explorer`.

1. Click on the third dropdown window from the top bar.
1. Select `New Launch Target`.
1. Select `ESP Target`.
1. Provide properties for the target where you would like to launch the application. Enter a `Name` for the target and select the `Serial Port` your ESP device is connected to on your machine.

![](docs/images/8_launch_target.png)

<a name="BuildApplication"></a>
# Compiling the Project

1. Select a project from the `Project Explorer`.

# Installing ESP-IDF Components

You can install the ESP-IDF Components directly into your project from the available components online. Follow the steps below:

* Right-click on the project from `Project Explorer` in which you want to add the component to and Select `Install ESP-IDF Components`.

  ![](docs/images/ESP-IDF_Components/install_components.png)

  A new window will open up showing all the available component to be installed.

* From the window, you can click on `Install` button to add that component to the project. To get to the readme file for that component you can click on `More Info` which will open the browser link to the readme file of that component.
  ![](docs/images/ESP-IDF_Components/components_window.png)

Already added components are also shown but the `Install` button changes text to `Already Added` and is disabled.

<a name="configureEnvironmentVariables"></a>
# Configuring Environment Variables

Eclipse configures automatically the required environment variables in the `Preferences` > `C/C++ Build` > `Environment` section if IDF Tools are installed using `Espressif` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install Tools` menu option. Required environment variables:

* `IDF_PATH`
* `PATH`
* `OPENOCD_SCRIPTS`
* `IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH`

If the required environment variables are not configured for any reason, please follow the step-by-step instructions below.

1. Click on the `Environment` preference page under `C/C++ Build`.
1. Click `Add…` again, and enter name `IDF_PATH`. The value should be the full path where ESP-IDF is installed.
1. Similarly, we should configure `OPENOCD_SCRIPTS`, `IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH` and `PATH` environment variables.

This is how they should look:

##### IDF_PATH #####
`/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf`

##### OPENOCD_SCRIPTS #####
`/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/openocd-esp32/v0.10.0-esp32-20190313/openocd-esp32/share/openocd/scripts`

##### IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH #####
`/Users/user-name/.espressif/python_env/idf4.0_py3.7_env`

##### PATH #####
`/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf/esp32-2019r1-8.2.0/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/esp32ulp-elf/2.28.51.20170517/esp32ulp-elf-binutils/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/cmake/3.13.4/CMake.app/Contents/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/openocd-esp32/v0.10.0-esp32-20190313/openocd-esp32/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/ninja/1.9.0/:/Users/user-name/.espressif/python_env/idf4.0_py3.7_env/bin:/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf/tools:$PATH`

![](docs/images/2_environment_pref.png)

# Configuring Toolchains

We need to tell Eclipse CDT what core build toolchain and CMake toolchain to use to build the project. However, this will be auto-detected if you've installed the tools using the `Espressif` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install Tools` option from Eclipse.

If these toolchains are not detected for any reason, please follow the step-by-step instructions below to add a new toolchain.

<a name="ConfigureToolchains"></a>
# Configuring Core Build Toolchains

1. Open Eclipse Preferences.
1. Navigate to `C/C++` > `Core Build Toolchains` preference page.
1. Click on `Add..` from the user-defined toolchains tables.
1. Select `GCC` as a toolchain type.
1. Click on `Next`.
1. Provide the GCC toolchain settings:

	* **Compiler:** /Users/user-name/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc,
	* **Operating System:** esp32,
	* **CPU Architecture:** xtensa

![](docs/images/6_core_build_toolchains.png)

<a name="ConfigureCMakeToolchain"></a>
# Configuring CMake Toolchain

We now need to tell CDT which toolchain to use when building the project. This will pass the required arguments to CMake when generating the Ninja files.

1. Navigate to `C/C++` > `CMake` preference page.
1. Click `Add...` and this will launch the New CMake toolchain configuration dialog.
1. Browse CMake toolchain `Path`. Example: `/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf/tools/cmake/toolchain-esp32.cmake`.
1. Select GCC Xtensa toolchain compiler from the drop-down list. Example: `esp32 xtensa /Users/user-name/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc`.

> **Note:**  Eclipse CDT has a bug in saving the toolchain preferences, hence it's recommended to restart Eclipse before we move further configuring the launch target.

![](docs/images/7_cmake_toolchain.png)

<a name="SelectDifferentToolchain"></a>
# Selecting Clang Toolchain

With ESP-IDF Eclipse Plugin v2.7.0 and higher you can build your project with the Clang toolchain

1. After updating/installing the ESP-IDF Eclipse plugin to v2.7.0 or higher, you need to run `Espressif` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install Tools` to update the toolchain list and environment variables, that are necessary for Clang toolchain.
1. After creating a new project, edit the project configuration
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/194882285-9faadb5d-0fe2-4012-bb6e-bc23dedbdbd2.png)
1. Go to `Build Settings` tab and select clang toolchain there:

> **Note:** Clang toolchain now is an experimental feature and you may face some build issues due to the incompatibility of esp-idf. Below is a description of how to fix the most common build issue on the current ESP-IDF master (ESP-IDF v5.1-dev-992-gaf28c1fa21-dirty). To work around clang build errors please refer to [this](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/WORKAROUNDS.md#clang-toolchain-buid-errors).

<a name="customizeLaunchConfig"></a>
# Launch Configuration

To provide the customized launch configuration and flash arguments, please follow the step-by-step instructions below.

1. Click on the `Launch Configuration` edit button.
1. Switch to the `Main` tab.
1. Specify the `Location` where this application has to run. Since `idf.py` is a python file, will configure the python system path. Example:`${system_path:python}`.
1. Specify `Working directory` of the application. Example: `${workspace_loc:/hello_world}`.
1. In additional arguments, provide a flashing command which will run in the specified working directory.
1. Flash command looks like this: `/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf/tools/idf.py -p /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART flash`.
1. Click OK to save the settings.
1. Click on the `Launch` icon to flash the application to the selected board.

# Troubleshooting

## Suggestions for Solving Errors from ESP-IDF by Hints Viewer

If you run into a problem during a build, chances are that there is a hint for this error in the ESP-IDF hint database, which is stored in `tools/idf_py_actions/hints.yml` of ESP-IDF. The ESP-IDF Eclipse plugin provides a hint viewer where you can type an error message and find a hint for it.
Prerequisites for it is to have `hints.yml`, which is available from ESP-IDF v5.0 and higher. If you are using lower versions of ESP-IDF, you can still use the hints viewer. To do it, you have to manually download the hints.yml file from [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/tools/idf_py_actions/hints.yml) and put it to your `esp-idf/tools/idf_py_actions/` path. To download a file from GitHub, right-click the `Raw` button and then `Save as...`.

To open the hints viewer go to `Windows` -> `Show View` -> `Other...` -> `Espressif` -> `Hints`. You will see the following view:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/189666994-78cc8b24-b934-426f-9df5-79af28c50c55.png)

Now you can type or copy paste some error from the build log, for example:
`ccache error: Failed to create temporary file for esp-idf/libsodium/CMakeFiles/..../....: No such file or directory`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/189672552-994624f3-c0c5-48e6-aa2c-61e4ed8915e5.png)

Double-clicking on the row will give you a hint message, so you can clearly see it if it doesn't fit on your screen in the table view.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/189673174-8ce40cda-6933-4dc4-a555-5d2ca617256e.png)

## Error Log

The Error Log view captures all the warnings and errors logged by plug-ins. The underlying log file is a .log file stored in the .metadata subdirectory of the workspace.

The Error Log view is available in `Window` > `Show View` > `Error Log`.

To export the current log view content into a file, press the Export Log toolbar button or select `Export Log...` from the context menu. Then, enter a file name.

Always provide an error log when reporting an issue.

![](docs/images/export_log.png)

## Console View Log

The Console View provides all the warnings and errors related to the current running process or build. To access the console view.

From the menu bar, `Window` > `Show View` > `Console`.

![](docs/images/CDT_Build_Console.png)

## CDT Global Build Log

Go to `Preferences > C/C++ > Build > Logging`

## Espressif IDF Tools Console

The Espressif IDF Tools Console is part of the Console view, this will be opened only during the installation of IDF tools from the Eclipse.

If you encounter any issue while installing the IDF tools using `Espressif` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install tools`, please check the Espressif IDF Tools Console to see the errors reported.

If this is not active, it can be switched by clicking on the `Display Selected Console` icon from the console view.

# GDBStub Debugging

You can now use the GDBStub debugging inside our Eclipse plugin to help you diagnose and debug issues on chips via Eclipse when it is in panic mode.

To enable GDBStub debugging for a project:

1. Launch the `sdkconfig` in project root by double-clicking on it which will open the configuration editor.
![](docs/images/GDBStubDebugging/sdkconfig_editor.png)

1. Expand the `Component Config` section and select `ESP System Settings`. From the settings on the right for `Panic Handler behaviour` select the `GDBStub on Panic option` from the list.
![](docs/images/GDBStubDebugging/sdkconfig_editor_panic_behavior.png)

Now you will be taken to the GDBStub debugger automatically when you connect the serial monitor and there is a panic for this example.

To use the GDBStub debugging for a project:

1. Create a template `hello_world` project and add the following lines in the main c file.

	```
	This is a global variable<br/>
	COREDUMP_DRAM_ATTR uint8_t global_var;
	```

1. Now add these two lines just above the `esp_restart()` function

	```
	global_var = 25;
	assert(0);
	```

The final file should be something like this:
![](docs/images/GDBStubDebugging/code_example.png)

Build and flash the project and launch the serial monitor. On line number 45, we are signaling for a failing assert which will put the chip in panic mode and when that line reaches, you will be prompted to switch the perspective to debug mode and the chip will be halted.

Remember that this is a panic mode and you cannot continue the execution from here, you will have to stop and restart the chip through IDF commands or simply restart the serial monitor.

![](docs/images/GDBStubDebugging/debug_panic_mode.png)

You can view the registers stack trace and even view the value of variables in the stack frame.

To exit the debug session simply press `stop` button.

<a name="coreDumpDebugging"></a>

# Core Dump Debugging

The IDF-Eclipse plugin allows you to debug the core dump if any crash occurs on the chip and the configurations are set. Currently only the UART core dump capture and debugging is supported.

To enable core dump debugging for a project:

1. You need to enable it first in `sdkconfig`. Launch the `sdkconfig` in the project root by double-clicking on it which will open the configuration editor

1. Click on the `Core Dump` from the settings on the left and select `Data Destination` as `UART`.
![](docs/images/CoreDumpDebugging/sdkconfig_editor.png)

This will enable the core dump debugging and whenever you connect a serial monitor for that project if any crash occurs it will load the dump and open a debug perspective in Eclipse to let you diagnose the dump where you can view all the information in the core dump.

You can view the registers stack trace and even view the value of variables in stack frame.

To exit the debug session: simply press stop button.

# Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) through USB

Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) is a mechanism for upgrading the firmware of devices through Universal Serial Bus (USB). There are a few requirements that need to be met:

- DFU is supported by ESP32-S2 and ESP32-S3 chips.
- You will need to do some electrical connection work (Here is a [guide](https://blog.espressif.com/dfu-using-the-native-usb-on-esp32-s2-for-flashing-the-firmware-b2c4af3335f1) for the ESP32-S2 board). The necessary connections for the USB peripheral are shown in the following table.

| GPIO | USB         |
| -----| ------------|
| 20   |  D+ (green) |
| 19   |  D- (white) |
| GND  |  GND (black)|
| +5V  |  +5V (red)  |

After meeting the above requirements:

1. The chip needs to be in bootloader mode for the detection as a DFU device and flashing. This can be achieved by pulling GPIO0 down (e.g. pressing the BOOT button), pulsing RESET down for a moment and releasing GPIO0.
1. Install USB drivers (Windows only). The drivers can be installed by the [Zadig tool](https://zadig.akeo.ie/>).
	- Please make sure that the device is in download mode before running the tool and that it detects the device before installing the drivers.
	- The Zadig tool might detect several USB interfaces of the target. Please install the WinUSB driver for only that interface for which there is no driver installed (probably it is Interface 2) and don't re-install the driver for the other interface.
	- The manual installation of the driver in Device Manager of Windows is not recommended because the flashing might not work properly.

After meeting the above requirements, you are free to build and flash via DFU. How to use DFU:

1. Edit the active launch configuration.
1. In the main tab, select the `Flash over DFU` option.
1. Select a suitable IDF target for DFU
1. Now, if you use the build command, an extra file (dfu.bin) will be created, which can be used later for flashing.

![DFU actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/226182180-286099d3-9c1c-4394-abb0-212d43054529.png)

Additional information, including common errors and known issues, is mentioned in this [guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-guides/dfu.html#usb-drivers-windows-only).

<a name="appLvlTracing"></a>
# Application Level Tracing

ESP-IDF provides a useful feature for program behavior analysis called [Application Level Tracing](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/api-guides/app_trace.html?). IDF-Eclipse plugin has UI, that allows the use of start, and stop tracing commands and process received data. To familiarize yourself with this library, you can use the [app_trace_to_host](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/release/v5.0/examples/system/app_trace_to_host) project or the [app_trace_basic](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/release/v5.1/examples/system/app_trace_basic) project if you are using esp-idf 5.1 and higher. These projects can be created from the plugin itself:
![](docs/images/AppLvlTracing_1.png)

Before you start using application-level tracing, it is important to create a debug configuration for the project where you must select the board you are using in order to successfully start the OpenOCD server.

![](docs/images/AppLvlTracing_3.png)

After debug configuration is created, right-click on the project in the `Project Explorer` and click on `ESP-IDF:Application Level Tracing`:

![](docs/images/AppLvlTracing_2.png)

It can take a while to open the application level tracing dialog because the OpenOCD server starts first, so you don't need to start it externally. At the very top of the application-level trace dialog, there are auto-configured fields that you can change for the trace start command.

Start command:

* Syntax: `start <outfile> [poll_period [trace_size [stop_tmo [wait4halt [skip_size]]]]`
* Argument:
	* `outfile`: Path to file to save data from both CPUs. This argument should have the following format: ``file://path/to/file``.
	* `poll_period`: Data polling period (in ms) for available trace data. If greater than 0 then command runs in non-blocking mode. By default, 1 ms.
	* `trace_size`: Maximum size of data to collect (in bytes). Tracing is stopped after specified amount of data is received. By default -1 (trace size stop trigger is disabled).
	* `stop_tmo`: Idle timeout (in sec). Tracing is stopped if there is no data for a specified period of time. By default -1 (disable this stop trigger). Optionally set it to a value longer than the longest pause between tracing commands from the target.
	* `wait4halt`: If 0 start tracing immediately, otherwise command waits for the target to be halted (after reset, by breakpoint etc.) and then automatically resumes it and starts tracing. By default, 0.
	* `skip_size`: Number of bytes to skip at the start. By default, 0.

Additional information can be found [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/api-guides/app_trace.html?).

![](docs/images/AppLvlTracing_4.png)

The next two fields `Trace Processing Script` and `Start Parsing Command` are used to parse the output file.

* `Trace Processing Script` is used to provide the path to the parsing script, by default it is logtrace_proc.py from esp-idf.
* `Start Parsing Command` allows you to check the resulting parsing command and edit it if it's necessary. By default, this field is automatically configured to match `$IDF_PATH/tools/esp_app_trace/logtrace_proc.py/path/to/trace/file/path/to/program/elf/file`.

Note the `Start parse` button is disabled until a dump file is available. To generate it, click the `Start` button at the bottom of the dialog box. After you click, the button changes to Stop so that you can stop tracking.

When the output file is generated, you can click on `Start parse` button, and you will see the parsed script output in the Eclipse console:

# NVS Table Editor

`NVS Table Editor` helps to create a binary file based on key-value pairs provided in a CSV file. The resulting binary file is compatible with NVS architecture defined in [ESP_IDF Non Volatile Storage](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/nvs_flash.html). The expected CSV format is:

```
	key,type,encoding,value     <-- column header (must be the first line)
	namespace_name,namespace,,  <-- First entry must be of type "namespace"
	key1,data,u8,1
	key2,file,string,/path/to/file
```
> Note: This is based on ESP-IDF [NVS Partition Generator Utility](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/nvs_partition_gen.html).

Steps:

1. Right-click on project in the `Project Explorer`
1. Select the `ESP-IDF: NVS Table Editor` command:

	![NVS Table Editor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/216114697-9f231211-f5dd-431b-9432-93ecc656cfec.png)

	> Note: This command is available in the IDF-Eclipse plugin 2.8.0 and higher

1. Make desired changes to CSV data
1. Save changes by clicking the `Save` button. If everything is ok, you will see an information message at the top of the dialog:

	![NVS_TABLE_EDITOR_2png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/216115906-9bb4fe55-293b-4c6b-8d22-0aa3520581ab.png)

1. Generate the partition binary (Choose `encrypt` to encrypt the binary and disable the generate key option to use your own key if desired). You will see an information message at the top of the dialog about the result of generated binaries. You can hover your mouse over it to read the whole message if it's too long:

	![NVS_Table_Editor_4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/216117261-9bee798a-3a9e-4be5-9466-fc9d3847834b.png)

	> Note: If there are any errors, you will see them highlight, hover on the error icon to read more about the error. Also, you will see an error message at the top of the dialog if saving the CSV file is not successful:

	![NVS_Table_editor_5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/216118486-69f819fa-7a95-49ae-805e-473cd2c424e8.png)
