<a name="InstallTools"></a>
# Installing ESP-IDF Tools
ESP-IDF requires some prerequisite tools to be installed so you can build firmware for the ESP32. The prerequisite tools include Python, Git, cross-compilers, menuconfig tool, CMake and Ninja build tools.

For this getting started guide, follow the instructions below.

* Navigate to `Help` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install Tools`
* Provide the `ESP-IDF Directory` path
* Provide `Git` and `Python` executable locations if they are not auto-detected.
* Click on `Install Tools` to proceed with the installation process. Check the Console for the installation details.
* Installation might take a while if you're doing it for the first time since it has to download and install xtensa-esp32-elf, esp32ulp-elf, cmake, openocd-esp32 and ninja tools.

> **Note:** Make sure you run this step even if you've already installed the required tools, since it sets the IDF_PATH, PATH, OPENOCD_SCRIPTS and IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH to the Eclipse CDT build environment based on the idf_tools.py export command.

<a name="NewProjectUsingTemplates"></a>
## Create a new project using ESP-IDF Templates
* Make sure you're in `C/C++ Perspective`
* Go to `File` > `New` > `Espressif IDF Project` (If you don't see this, please reset the perspective from `Window` > `Perspective` > `Reset Perspective..`)
* Provide the `Project name`
* Click `Next`
* Check `Create a project using one of the templates`
* Select the required template from the tree
* Click `Finish`

> **Note:** You will see a lot of unresolved inclusion errors in the editor and those will be resolved only after the build.

![](docs/images/4_new_project_templates.png)

<a name="ConfigureLaunchTarget"></a>
# Configuring Launch target
Next, we need to tell CDT to use the toolchain for our project so that all the headers will be indexed and resolved. This is accomplished through the Launch Bar, the new widget set you see on the far left of the toolbar. This will be shown only when you have a project in the project explorer.

* Click on the third dropdown 
* Select `New Launch Target`
* Select `ESP Target`
* Provide properties for the target where you would like to launch the application. Enter a `Name` for the target and select the `Serial Port` your ESP device is connected to on your machine.

![](docs/images/8_launch_target.png)

<a name="BuildApplication"></a>
# Compiling the Project
* Select a project from the Project Explorer
* Select `Run` from the first drop-down, which is called `Launch Mode`
* Select your application from the second drop-down, which is called `Launch Configuration`(Auto-detected)
* Select target from the third drop-down, which is called `Launch Target`
* Now click on the `Build` button widget which you see on the far left of the toolbar

![](docs/images/9_cmake_build.png)

<a name="FlashApplication"></a>
# Flashing the Project
ESP-IDF has a tool called `idf.py` which is a wrapper around make flash command with some handy operations. Flash operation can be initiated with just a click of a launch button(second button from the left) and it's auto-configured to flash the application with the default flash command i.e, `idf.py -p PORT flash`.

To provide the customized flash arguments, please follow [this](#customizeLaunchConfig) link for further instructions.

<a name="ConfigureLaunchTerminal"></a>
# Viewing Serial Output
To see the serial output in Eclipse, we need to configure the `ESP-IDF Serial Monitor` to connect to the serial port.

* Click on the `Open a Terminal` icon from the toolbar
* Choose `ESP-IDF Serial Monitor` from the terminal drop-down
* Select `Serial Port` for your board if it's not detected. Baud Rate and Serial Port settings are auto-configured by default. 
* Click on `OK` to launch the terminal, which will listen to the USB port

![](docs/images/10_serial_terminal.png)

<a name="projectconfigure"></a>
# Configuring the Project
IDF plugin will allow you to configure `sdkconfig` without leaving the Eclipse environment.

## SDK Configuration editor
Project configuration is held in a single file called `sdkconfig` in the root directory of the project. This configuration file can be modified using `SDK Configuration Editor`

To launch the SDK Configuration editor:
* Navigate to `sdkconfig` file
* Double click on the file to launch the SDK configuration editor
* Use `Ctrl+S` or  `Command+S` based on the OS environment to save the changes. You can also use Eclipse `Save` button from the toolbar
* To revert the sdkconfig editor changes, you can either close the editor without saving them or you can right click on the `sdkconfig` file and select `Load sdkconfig` menu option to revert the changes from the editor.

![](docs/images/13_sdkconfig_editor.png)

<a name="cmakeproject"></a>
# CMake Editor
CMake Editor Plug-in is integrated with IDF Plugin for editing CMake files such as CMakeLists.txt. It provides syntax coloring, CMake command content assist, and code templates.

![](docs/images/cmake_editor_ca.png)

CMake editor preferences can be controlled using `Eclipse > Preferences > CMakeEd`

# ESP-IDF Application Size Analysis
Application Size Analysis editor provides a way to analyze the static memory footprint of your application. It has two sections - Overview and Details. The **Overview** section provides a summary of the application memory usage and the **Details** section will have in-depth details about components and per-symbol level memory information.

Details table viewer also provides you with searching and sorting capabilities on various columns.

To launch the Application Size Analysis editor:
* Right-click on the project
* Select `ESP-IDF: Application Size Analysis` menu option to launch the editor

**Application Size Analysis - Overview**

# ESP-IDF Terminal
This would launch a local terminal with all the environment variables which are set under `Preferences > C/C++ > Build > Environment`. The default working directory would be either the currently selected project or IDF_PATH if there is no project selected. 

The terminal PATH is also configured with `esptool`, `espcoredump`, `partition_table`, and `app_update` component paths so that it will be handy to access them directly from the ESP-IDF terminal.

To launch the ESP-IDF Terminal:
* Click on the `Open a Terminal` icon from the toolbar
* Choose `ESP-IDF Terminal` from the terminal drop-down and click `OK` to launch a terminal

![](docs/images/idf_terminal.png)

<a name="configureEnvironmentVariables"></a>
# Configuring Environment Variables
Eclipse auto configures the required environment variables in the `Preferences > C/C++ Build > Environment` section if IDF Tools are installed using `Help` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install Tools` menu option.

Required environment variables:
* IDF_PATH
* PATH
* OPENOCD_SCRIPTS
* IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH

If the required environment variables are not configured for any reason, please follow the step by step instructions below.
* Click on the `Environment` preference page under `C/C++ Build`. 
* Click “Add…” again, and enter name `IDF_PATH`. The value should be the full path where ESP-IDF is installed.
* Similarly we shoud configure OPENOCD_SCRIPTS, IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH and PATH environment variables

This is how they should look:

##### IDF_PATH #####
`/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf`

##### OPENOCD_SCRIPTS #####
`/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/openocd-esp32/v0.10.0-esp32-20190313/openocd-esp32/share/openocd/scripts`

##### IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH #####
`/Users/user-name/.espressif/python_env/idf4.0_py3.7_env`

##### PATH #####
`/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf/esp32-2019r1-8.2.0/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/esp32ulp-elf/2.28.51.20170517/esp32ulp-elf-binutils/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/cmake/3.13.4/CMake.app/Contents/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/openocd-esp32/v0.10.0-esp32-20190313/openocd-esp32/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/ninja/1.9.0/:/Users/user-name/.espressif/python_env/idf4.0_py3.7_env/bin:/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf/tools:$PATH`

In the above path, the last segment `$PATH` needs to be replaced with the system environment PATH based on the operating system.
For example, to get the system environment PATH.
- In macOS,  `$echo $PATH ` 
- In Windows, `$echo %PATH%`

![](docs/images/2_environment_pref.png)

# Configuring Toolchains
We need to tell Eclipse CDT what core build toolchain and CMake toolchain need to be used to build the project. However, this will be auto-detected if you've installed the tools using the `Help > ESP-IDF Tools Manager > Install Tools` option from the Eclipse.

If these toolchains are not detected for any reason, please follow the step by step instructions below to add a new toolchain.

<a name="ConfigureToolchains"></a>
# Configuring Core Build Toolchains

* Open Eclipse Preferences
* Navigate to `C/C++  -> “Core Build Toolchains` preference page
* Click on `Add..` from the User defined Toolchians tables
* Select `GCC` as a toolchain type
* Click on `Next>`
* Provide the GCC Toolchain Settings:

**Compiler:** /Users/user-name/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc,
**Operating System:** esp32,
**CPU Architecture:** xtensa

![](docs/images/6_core_build_toolchains.png)

<a name="ConfigureCMakeToolchain"></a>
# Configuring CMake Toolchain
We now need to tell CDT which toolchain to use when building the project. This will pass the required arguments to CMake when generating the Ninja files.

* Navigate to “C/C++  -> “CMake” preference page
* Click `Add..` and this will launch the New CMake Toolchain configuration dialog
* Browse CMake toolchain `Path`. Example: `/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf/tools/cmake/toolchain-esp32.cmake`
* Select GCC Xtensa Toolchain compiler from the drop-down list. Example: `esp32 xtensa /Users/user-name/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc`

> **NOTE:**  Eclipse CDT has a bug in saving the toolchain preferences, hence it's recommended to restart Eclipse before we move further configuring the launch target.

![](docs/images/7_cmake_toolchain.png)

<a name="customizeLaunchConfig"></a>
# Launch Configuration
To provide the customized launch configuration and flash arguments, please follow the step by step instructions below.

* Click on the `Launch Configuration` edit button
* Switch to the `Main` tab
* Specify the `Location` where this application has to run. Since `idf.py` is a python file, will configure the python system path. Example:`${system_path:python}`
* Specify `Working directory` of the application. Example: `${workspace_loc:/hello_world}`
* In additional arguments, provide a flashing command which will run in the specified working directory
* Flash command looks like this: `/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf/tools/idf.py -p /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART flash`
* Click OK to save the settings
* Click on the `Launch` icon to flash the application to the selected board
