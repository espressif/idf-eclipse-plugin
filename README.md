# Installing ESP-IDF
To install ESP-IDF directly from the Eclipse

1. Go to `Espressif` > `Download and Configure ESP-IDF`
1. From the `Download ESP-IDF` section, choose ESP-IDF version and directory to download
1. Click on `Finish`

To configure an existing ESP-IDF

1. Go to `Espressif` > `Download and Configure ESP-IDF`
1. Check `Use an existing ESP-IDF directory from the file system`
1. Choose an existing ESP-IDF directory from the file system
1. Click on `Finish`

This will download a specified esp-idf version and configures `IDF_PATH` in the Eclipse CDT build environment variables.

![](docs/images/espidf_download.png)

# Installing ESP-IDF Tools
ESP-IDF requires some prerequisite tools to be installed so you can build firmware for the ESP32. The prerequisite tools include Python, Git, cross-compilers, menuconfig tool, CMake and Ninja build tools.

For this getting started guide, follow the instructions below.

1. Navigate to `Espressif` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install Tools`
1. Provide the `ESP-IDF Directory` path
1. Provide `Git` and `Python` executable locations if they are not auto-detected.
1. Click on `Install Tools` to proceed with the installation process. Check the Console for the installation details.
1. Installation might take a while if you're doing it for the first time since it has to download and install xtensa-esp32-elf, esp32ulp-elf, cmake, openocd-esp32 and ninja tools.

> **Note:** Make sure you run this step even if you've already installed the required tools, since it sets the `IDF_PATH`, `PATH`, `OPENOCD_SCRIPTS` and `IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH` to the Eclipse CDT build environment based on the idf_tools.py export command.

![](docs/images/install_tools.png)

ESP-IDF Directory selection dialog:

Already added components are also shown but the `Install` button changes text to `Already Added` and is disabled.

<a name="configureEnvironmentVariables"></a>
# Configuring Environment Variables
Eclipse auto configures the required environment variables in the `Preferences` > `C/C++ Build` > `Environment` section if IDF Tools are installed using `Espressif` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install Tools` menu option.

Required environment variables:
* `IDF_PATH`
* `PATH`
* `OPENOCD_SCRIPTS`
* `IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH`

If the required environment variables are not configured for any reason, please follow the step by step instructions below.
* Click on the `Environment` preference page under `C/C++ Build`. 
* Click `Add…` again, and enter name `IDF_PATH`. The value should be the full path where ESP-IDF is installed.
* Similarly we should configure `OPENOCD_SCRIPTS`, `IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH` and `PATH` environment variables

This is how they should look:

##### IDF_PATH #####
`/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf`

##### OPENOCD_SCRIPTS #####
`/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/openocd-esp32/v0.10.0-esp32-20190313/openocd-esp32/share/openocd/scripts`

##### IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH #####
`/Users/user-name/.espressif/python_env/idf4.0_py3.7_env`

##### PATH #####
`/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf/esp32-2019r1-8.2.0/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/esp32ulp-elf/2.28.51.20170517/esp32ulp-elf-binutils/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/cmake/3.13.4/CMake.app/Contents/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/openocd-esp32/v0.10.0-esp32-20190313/openocd-esp32/bin:/Users/user-name/.espressif/tools/ninja/1.9.0/:/Users/user-name/.espressif/python_env/idf4.0_py3.7_env/bin:/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf/tools:$PATH`

![](docs/images/2_environment_pref.png)

# Configuring Toolchains
We need to tell Eclipse CDT what core build toolchain and CMake toolchain need to be used to build the project. However, this will be auto-detected if you've installed the tools using the `Espressif` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install Tools` option from the Eclipse.

If these toolchains are not detected for any reason, please follow the step by step instructions below to add a new toolchain.

<a name="ConfigureToolchains"></a>
# Configuring Core Build Toolchains

1. Open Eclipse Preferences
1. Navigate to `C/C++` > `Core Build Toolchains` preference page
1. Click on `Add..` from the User defined Toolchains tables
1. Select `GCC` as a toolchain type
1. Click on `Next`
1. Provide the GCC Toolchain Settings:

**Compiler:** /Users/user-name/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc,
**Operating System:** esp32,
**CPU Architecture:** xtensa

![](docs/images/6_core_build_toolchains.png)

<a name="ConfigureCMakeToolchain"></a>
# Configuring CMake Toolchain
We now need to tell CDT which toolchain to use when building the project. This will pass the required arguments to CMake when generating the Ninja files.

1. Navigate to `C/C++` > `CMake` preference page
1. Click `Add...` and this will launch the New CMake Toolchain configuration dialog
1. Browse CMake toolchain `Path`. Example: `/Users/user-name/esp/esp-idf/tools/cmake/toolchain-esp32.cmake`
1. Select GCC Xtensa Toolchain compiler from the drop-down list. Example: `esp32 xtensa /Users/user-name/esp/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc`

> **NOTE:**  Eclipse CDT has a bug in saving the toolchain preferences, hence it's recommended to restart Eclipse before we move further configuring the launch target.

![](docs/images/7_cmake_toolchain.png)

<a name="SelectDifferentToolchain"></a>
# Selecting Clang Toolchain
With ESP-IDF Eclipse Plugin v2.7.0 and higher you can build your project with Clang Toolchain

1. After updating/installing the ESP-IDF Eclipse plugin to v2.7.0 or higher,  you need to run `Espressif -> ESP-IDF Tools Manager -> Install Tools` to update the toolchain list and environment variables, that are necessary for Clang Toolchain.
1. After creating a new project, edit project's configuration
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/194882285-9faadb5d-0fe2-4012-bb6e-bc23dedbdbd2.png)

# Troubleshooting 

## Suggestions for solving errors from ESP-IDF by hints viewer

If you run into a problem during a build, chances are that there is a hint for this error in the esp-idf hint database, which is stored in `tools/idf_py_actions/hints.yml` of ESP-IDF. The ESP-IDF Eclipse plugin provides a hint viewer where you can type an error message and find a hint for it. 
Prerequisites for it is to have `hints.yml`, which is available from esp-idf v5.0 and higher. If you are using lower version of the esp-idf, you can still use the hints viewer. To do it, you have manually download the hints.yml file from [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/tools/idf_py_actions/hints.yml) and put it to your `esp-idf/tools/idf_py_actions/` path. To download a file from the github, right click the `Raw` button and then `Save as...`

To open hints viewer go to `Windows -> Show View -> Other... -> Espressif -> Hints`. You will see the following view:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/189666994-78cc8b24-b934-426f-9df5-79af28c50c55.png)

Now you can type or copy paste some error from the build log, for example:
`ccache error: Failed to create temporary file for esp-idf/libsodium/CMakeFiles/..../....: No such file or directory`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/189672552-994624f3-c0c5-48e6-aa2c-61e4ed8915e5.png)

Double clicking on the row will give you a hint message so you can clearly see it if it doesn't fit on your screen in the table view.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/189673174-8ce40cda-6933-4dc4-a555-5d2ca617256e.png)

## Error Log
The Error Log view captures all the warnings and errors logged by plug-ins. The underlying log file is a .log file stored in the .metadata subdirectory of the workspace. 

The Error Log view is available in `Window` > `Show View` > `Error Log`.

To export the current log view content into a file, press the Export Log toolbar button or select `Export Log...` from the context menu. Then, enter a file name.

Always provide an error log when reporting an issue.

![](docs/images/export_log.png)

## Console View Log
The Console View provides all the warnings and errors related to the current running process or build. To access the console view.

From the menu bar, `Window` > `Show View` > `Console`. 

![](docs/images/CDT_Build_Console.png)

## CDT Global Build Log
Go to `Preferences > C/C++ > Build > Logging`

## Espressif IDF Tools Console
The Espressif IDF Tools Console is part of Console view, this will be opened only during the installation of IDF tools from the Eclipse. 

If you encounter any issue while installing the IDF tools using `Espressif` > `ESP-IDF Tools Manager` > `Install tools`, please check the Espressif IDF Tools Console to see the errors reported.

If this is not active, it can be switched by clicking on the `Display Selected Console` icon from the console view.

# GDBStub Debugging
You can now use the gdb stub debugging inside our eclipse plugin to help you diagnose and debug issues on chip via eclipse when it is in panic mode.

To enable gdb stub debugging for a project you need to enable it first in the sdkconfig. Launch the sdkconfig in project root by double clicking on it which will open the configuration editor.
![](docs/images/GDBStubDebugging/sdkconfig_editor.png)

Expand the `Component Config` section and select `ESP System Settings`. From the settings on the right for `Panic Handler behaviour` select the `GDBStub on Panic option` from the list
![](docs/images/GDBStubDebugging/sdkconfig_editor_panic_behavior.png)


Now you will be taken to the gdbstub debugger automatically when you connect the serial monitor and there is a panic for this example. 

Create a template `hello_world` project and add the following lines in the main c file.

```
This is a global variable<br/>
COREDUMP_DRAM_ATTR uint8_t global_var;
```

Now add these two lines just above `esp_restart()` function<br/>
`global_var = 25;`<br/>
`assert(0);`<br/>
The final file should be something like this
![](docs/images/GDBStubDebugging/code_example.png)

Build and flash the project and launch the serial monitor. On the line number 45 we are signaling for a failing assert which will put the chip in panic mode and when that line reaches you will be prompted to switch the perspective to debug mode and the chip will be halted, remember that this is a panic mode and you cannot continue the execution from here you will have to stop and restart the chip through idf commands or simply restart the serial monitor.
![](docs/images/GDBStubDebugging/debug_panic_mode.png)

You can view the registers stack trace and even view the value of variables in stack frame. To exit the debug session simply press stop button.


<a name="coreDumpDebugging"></a>

# Core Dump Debugging

The idf eclipse plugin allows you to debug the core dump if any crash occurs on the chip and the configurations are set. Currently only the UART core dump capture and debugging is supported.

To enable core dump debugging for a project you need to enable it first in the sdkconfig. Launch the sdkconfig in project root by double clicking on it which will open the configuration editor.
<br/>
Click on the the `Core Dump` from the settings on the left. and select Data Destination as `UART`.
![](docs/images/CoreDumpDebugging/sdkconfig_editor.png)

This will enable the core dump debugging and whenever you connect a serial monitor for that project if any crash occurs it will load the dump and open a debug perspective in eclipse to let you diagnose the dump where you can view all the information in the core dump.

You can view the registers stack trace and even view the value of variables in stack frame. To exit the debug session simply press stop button.

# Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) through USB

Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) is a mechanism for upgrading the firmware of devices through Universal Serial Bus (USB). There are a few  requirements that need to be met:

- DFU is supported by ESP32-S2 and  ESP32-S3 chips. 
- You will need to do some electrical connection work (Here is a [guide](https://blog.espressif.com/dfu-using-the-native-usb-on-esp32-s2-for-flashing-the-firmware-b2c4af3335f1) for the ESP32-S2 board). The necessary connections for the USB peripheral are shown in the following table.

| GPIO | USB         |
| -----| ------------|
| 20   |  D+ (green) |
| 19   |  D- (white) |
| GND  |  GND (black)|
| +5V  |  +5V (red)  |

- The chip needs to be in bootloader mode for the detection as a DFU device and flashing. This can beachieved by pulling GPIO0 down (e.g. pressing the BOOT button), pulsing RESET down for a moment and releasing GPIO0.
- Install USB drivers (Windows only). The drivers can be installed by the [Zadig tool](https://zadig.akeo.ie/>). The manual installation of the driver in Device Manager of Windows is not recommended because the flashing might not work properly. Please make sure that the device is in
download mode before running the tool and that it detects the device before installing the drivers. The Zadig
tool might detect several USB interfaces of the target. Please install the WinUSB driver for only that interface for
which there is no driver installed (probably it is Interface 2) and don't re-install the driver for the other interface. 

After meeting requirements you are free to build and flash via DFU. How to use DFU:

- Activate the DFU toggle button on the toolbar.
- Select the correct target and port through the target panel
- Now, if you will use the build command an extra file will be created (dfu.bin), which will be later used for flashing.

![DFU actions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/175890153-42bd711e-a916-408e-a568-9b008f86a8b6.png)

# Application Level Tracing

ESP-IDF provides a useful feature for program behavior analysis called [Application Level Tracing](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/api-guides/app_trace.html?). IDF-Eclipse plugin has UI, that allows using start, stop tracing commands and process received data. To familiarize yourself with this library, you can use the [app_trace_to_host](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/system/app_trace_to_host) project. This project can be created from the plugin itself:
![](docs/images/AppLvlTracing_1.png)

Before you start using application-level tracing, it is important to create a debug configuration for the project where you must select the board you are using in order to successfully start the OpenOCD server.

![](docs/images/AppLvlTracing_3.png)

After debug configuration is created, right click on the project in project explorer and click on `ESP-IDF:Application Level Tracing`:

![](docs/images/AppLvlTracing_2.png)

It can take a while to open the application level tracing dialog because the OpenOCD server starts first, so you don't need to start it externally. At the very top of the application-level trace dialog, there are auto-configured fields that you can change for the trace start command.


Start command:

* Syntax: `start <outfile> [poll_period [trace_size [stop_tmo [wait4halt [skip_size]]]]`
* Argument: 
	* `outfile`: Path to file to save data from both CPUs. This argument should have the following format: ``file://path/to/file``.
	* `poll_period`: Data polling period (in ms) for available trace data. If greater than 0 then command runs in non-blocking mode. By default, 1 ms.
	* `trace_size`: Maximum size of data to collect (in bytes). Tracing is stopped after specified amount of data is received. By default -1 (trace size stop trigger is disabled).
	* `stop_tmo`: Idle timeout (in sec). Tracing is stopped if there is no data for a specified period of time. By default -1 (disable this stop trigger). Optionally set it to a value longer than the longest pause between tracing commands from the target.
	* `wait4halt`: If 0 start tracing immediately, otherwise command waits for the target to be halted (after reset, by breakpoint etc.) and then automatically resumes it and starts tracing. By default, 0.
	* `skip_size`: Number of bytes to skip at the start. By default, 0.

Additional information can be found [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/api-guides/app_trace.html?).
![](docs/images/AppLvlTracing_4.png)


The next two fields `Trace Processing Script` and `Start Parsing Command` are used to parse the output file. 

* `Trace Processing Script` is used to provide the path to the parsing script, by default it is logtrace_proc.py from esp-idf. 
* `Start Parsing Command` allows you to check the resulting parsing command and edit it if it's necessary. By default, this field is automatically configured to match `$IDF_PATH/tools/esp_app_trace/logtrace_proc.py/path/to/trace/file/path/to/program/elf/file`. Note the `Start parse` button is disabled until a dump file is available. To generate it, click the Start button at the bottom of the dialog box. After you click, the button changes to Stop so that you can stop tracking.

When output file is generated, you can click on `Start parse` button and you will see parse script output in the eclipse console:

# Partition Table Editor UI for ESP-IDF

`ESP-IDF: Partition Table Editor` command allows to edit your [partition table](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/partition-tables.html) in a more convenient way, where you can see the supported types and subtypes and monitor the correctness of the entered data.

> Note: This command is available in the idf-eclipse plugin 2.8.0 and higher

Steps:
1. Open any IDF Project in Project Explorer where you want to have custom partition table.
2. To use a custom partition table, `Custom partition table CSV' must be set in the sdkconfig like this:

![partition_table_editor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/216104107-2844068b-8412-468b-931f-b4778af4417c.png)

# NVS Table Editor

`NVS Table Editor` helps to create a binary file based on key-value pairs provided in a CSV file. The resulting binary file is compatible with NVS architecture defined in [ESP_IDF Non Volatile Storage](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/nvs_flash.html). The expected CSV format is:

```
key,type,encoding,value     <-- column header (must be the first line)
namespace_name,namespace,,  <-- First entry must be of type "namespace"
key1,data,u8,1
key2,file,string,/path/to/file
```
> Note: This is based on ESP-IDF [NVS Partition Generator Utility](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/nvs_partition_gen.html). 

Steps: 
1. Right click on project in the Project Explorer
2. Select the `ESP-IDF: NVS Table Editor` command:

![NVS Table Editor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/216114697-9f231211-f5dd-431b-9432-93ecc656cfec.png)
> Note: This command is available in the idf-eclipse plugin 2.8.0 and higher
3. Make desire changes to CSV data.
4. Save changes by clicking the `Save` button. If everything is ok, you will see an information message at the top of the dialog:
![NVS_TABLE_EDITOR_2png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/216115906-9bb4fe55-293b-4c6b-8d22-0aa3520581ab.png)
5. Generate the partition binary (Choose encrypt to encrypt the binary and disable the generate key option to use your own key if desired). You will see an information message at the  top of the dialog about the result of generation the binaries.  you can hover your mouse over it to read the whole message if it's too long:
![NVS_Table_Editor_4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/216117261-9bee798a-3a9e-4be5-9466-fc9d3847834b.png)

Note: If there are any errors, you will see them highlight, hover on the error icon to read more about the error. Also, the error message at the top of the dialog if saving the CSV file is not successful: 

![NVS_Table_editor_5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24419842/216118486-69f819fa-7a95-49ae-805e-473cd2c424e8.png)

After all these steps, you should see `nvs.csv` and `nvs.bin` files in the project directory.
