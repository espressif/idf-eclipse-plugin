## "Unresolved inclusion" errors in the editor
Unresolved inclusion errors will be resolved only after the build. Make sure you select the `ESP` Launch Target before you trigger the build so that CDT will correctly identify the toolchain to build and index the sources. Check [Configure Launch Target](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#ConfigureLaunchTarget) for more details.

If you still see the errors, please try `Project > C/C++ Index > Rebuild` and see if it helps.
## "No Toolchain found for Target ESP32" error
You need to make sure you run the [Install Tools](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#installing-esp-idf-tools) from the Eclipse. This will take care of configuring the required paths in the CDT build environment along with installing the tools.

Check [Configuring core build toolchains](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#configuring-core-build-toolchains)
## "No esp launch target found. Please create/select the correct Launch Target" error
You see this error when you're trying a compile a project without selecting an `ESP` launch target. Check [this](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin#configuring-launch-target)
## How can I rollback to old ESP-IDF Eclipse plugin?
- Open Eclipse IDE and Uninstall the esp-idf plugin
- Restart Eclipse IDE
- Download the previous version of the ESP Eclipse Plugin using this [link](https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/releases)
- Goto `Help > Install New Software`
- Press the `Add` button, a window will open with the name of `Add Repository`
- Press the `Archive` button and select the file downloaded
- Proceed with the installation
- Restart Eclipse
## Where can I find Compiler_commands.json file for the project?

## How do I report a deadlock or Eclipse hang?
You can find the detailed instructions here https://wiki.eclipse.org/How_to_report_a_deadlock
- On command line, use `jps -v` to find the PIDs of Java processes and jstack <pid> to show the stack trace of Java processes.
<pre>
<code>$ jps -v
32308 org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.5.0.v20180119-0753.jar -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.8 -Dosgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/eclipse-workspace -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.8 -Dosgi.dataAreaRequiresExplicitInit=true -Xms256m -Xmx1024m -Dswt.dbus.init
8824 Jps -Dapplication.home=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle -Xms8m
$ jstack 32308 > /tmp/jstack.txt
</code></pre>
Here 32308 and 8824 are PIDs of Java processes. 8824 is jps itself and is of no interest for us. 32308 is and Eclipse process judging from presence of org.eclipse.equinox.launcher in its command line. Jstack command saves stack trace of Eclipse process in a file /tmp/jstack.txt, attach the file to bug report.
## `sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed:` error while installing the plugins through update site
This would have caused by the Java version or Java certificates. Please make sure you've installed `Java 11 and later` to fix this error.

## Why Java 11 recommended for IDF Eclipse Plugin?
We recommend using Java 11(that's the latest LTS version from Oracle) and above while working with IDF Eclipse Plugin considering Eclipse 2020-06 has a requirement for Java 11 to work with the CDT. Here are some important pointers from Eclipse.

### Installing CDT 9.11 on Eclipse 2020-06 and later requires a workaround when using Java 8
Check this - https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/NewIn911#Release

CDT 9.11 only requires Java 8 to run. However, a new feature in Eclipse 2020-06 and later means that the install wizard may prevent installation. The workaround is to disable "Verify provisioning operation is compatible with currently running JRE" in Windows -> Preferences -> Install/Update. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=564407#c1

### CDT 10.0 required Java 11 or later
Check this - https://wiki.eclipse.org/CDT/User/NewIn100

Starting with CDT 10.0 Java 11 or later is required to run CDT. This aligns with requirements of Eclipse IDE which also requires Java 11 to run starting in 2020-09.
